# Two-Pass-Assembler
Algorithm Initially we have to give the location of the file as an input. The file is then checked for existence at the location provided as input. If the file is not present, an error message is printed as output, but if its present, the machine language code in the file is converted into assembly language. The input file can have the following formats: a) Opcode, b) Label/ Variable, c) Operand, or d) Comments. Moreover, the code is of a Two Pass Assembler, it is processed two times. The Assembler processes the code line by line in the first pass and looks for any errors that may be present in the assembly code. The Assembler will ignore the error if possible, otherwise it will skip the line of the error. In case no error is found, it will find out the Labels/Literals/Variables in the lines and add them to the Symbol or Literal Table, as the case may be. As the Variables are declared, the Symbol Table is also updated simultaneously. A fragment of the machine code (devoid of literal and variable addresses) is generated in the second pass. Once the STOP statement is discovered, all the addresses are given to the Literals and Variables. Eventually, the machine language code is updated with the addresses and the process comes to an end.
